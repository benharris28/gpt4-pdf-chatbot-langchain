Tax workers prep to hit the picket line
If you thought tax season couldn’t get any more stressful, the people responsible for processing those returns may be out of office in the near future.
What happened: Over 35,000 tax workers are in a position to strike after union members of the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) voted “overwhelmingly” last Friday for a mandate to walk out. They’re fighting for a new collective bargaining agreement with higher wages.
They are demanding raises equalling 20.5% over three years and an immediate 9% bump, arguing the increases are necessary due to inflation. 
 
A final round of negotiations is scheduled for April 17th to April 20th—if those fail, CRA workers could walk off the job as soon as next week.
Why it matters: For anyone new to adulting (or who continually forgets), the tax filing deadline is May 1st this year. If the strike happens, it could result in delays for returns and create a major headache for anyone who hasn’t busted out TurboTax yet.
While most tax returns are processed instantly, the strike could stifle Canadians’ access to CRA services during the busiest stretch of tax time. 
Zoom out: Mounting labour unrest is another consequence of persistent inflation, as workers try to secure pay hikes in line with rising prices. Over 120,000 Treasury Board employees will also conclude voting on strike action today, which could disrupt everything from airports to Stats Canada’s economic data releases.

Run, Biden, run. US President Joe Biden will run for re-election in 2024, though he is not yet ready to formally launch his campaign. At 80 years old, Biden is already the oldest president in US history. If he were to win a second term, he would be 86 by the end of it. Currently, two other democrats have said they would run for office in 2024. (BBC) 

Uber CEO gets behind the wheel. Dara Khosrowshahi and other Uber execs took shifts as drivers, carrying passengers and delivering food, to better understand the driver experience. The experiment is part of a broader push to secure more drivers and has already led to changes in the app, including modifying the sign-up process and ordering queues. (WSJ)

Canada needs farmers. Canada will be short 24,000 farmers by 2033, per a new study from RBC and the University of Guelph, as ~40% of farmers are set to retire over the next ten years. The report suggests Canada must welcome 30,000 permanent immigrants—to take over farms or establish new ones‚ to prevent a mass labour shortage. (CTV)—QH

While you’ve been counting sheep, Sleep Country has been counting dollars. 

What happened: Sleep Country is paying US$20.6 million for the Canadian assets of US mattress company Casper, which pioneered the now-popular mattress-in-a-box biz model.

The two companies have been partners since 2021, with Sleep Country selling Casper products in its stores and helping develop the brand in Canada. 
Canada’s leader in all things Zzzs is truly cornering the ‘mattresses you heard about through podcast ads’ market. In 2018, it bought Canadian mattress startup Endy for CA$88.7 million.

The company has also invested in snoozy startup Sleepout (which makes curtains) and bought two other Canadian D2C sleep brands, Silk & Snow and Hush Blankets. 
Why it’s happening: With Casper and Endy, Sleep Country can target younger shoppers at competing price points. The price of an Endy mattress tops out at around ~$1,450, and Casper offers options upwards of $5,000.

And if money is no object in exchange for sweet dreams, you can still drop $10,000  for a horsetail hair and Belgian Jacquard damask (no idea what that is) king bed. 
Sleep Country enjoyed robust sales throughout the pandemic until last quarter, when net income dropped by ~21% as consumers saved money and stuck with their lumpy old bunks.  

Bottom line: Sleep Country’s famous jingle asks, “Why buy a mattress anywhere else?”  These days, maybe they could change it to, “Can you even buy a mattress anywhere else?”—QH

The Mr. Big tactic has a 95% success rate in jailing criminals, but critics want it banned. 

Driving the news: This Canadian policing tactic, which involves creating fake criminal groups—like a gang—to trick real criminals into confessing to crimes they’ve committed, is being challenged in courts. Opponents also want it outlawed, per The New York Times. 

The tactic, invented by the RCMP, has been used to solve over 350 cold cases in Canada since 2008. Of resulting prosecutions, 95% have ended in convictions.
 
The target (usually a murder suspect) is often enticed to engage in criminal acts by the fake gang. Ultimately, the goal is to coerce a confession for previous crimes.
In 2014, the Supreme Court ruled the technique can be unreliable and manipulative: targets are unaware of their right to remain silent or speak to a lawyer. They’re also compensated for performing “favours” for the fake groups. Still, it’s often used as a last-resort option. 

Some lawyers say the tactic is a breeding ground for false confessions. A number of people convicted through Mr. Big have been exonerated after suing law enforcement. 
Bottom line: The effectiveness of the tactic makes it difficult to advocate against it, Michele Ruyters, a criminal law professor, told The New York Times. Beyond Canada, countries like Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands have also adopted the Mr. Big technique.—SB 

🏡 US$1.65 million. The average price for a house in the Hamptons—the famously bougie Long Island enclave—down 7.6% from last year, falling for the first time since 2019.

🙁 34%. Canadians who are in either “bad” or “terrible” financial shape, per a new Angus Reid survey. That number is 7% higher than it was at the start of the pandemic.
